Things in Space
===============

Stuff in Space is a realtime 3D map of objects in Earth orbit, visualized using WebGL. The
current version is available live at [http://stuffin.space](http://stuffin.space).


The website updates daily with orbit data from Space-Track.org and uses the excellent 
[satellite.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/satellite.js) Javascript library to
calculate satellite positions.
